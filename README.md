## Application architecture

## External assets

A number of assets used in the app come from other repositories, and should be periodically updated. Because updating these items can be a lengthy process it is performed manually rather than at build time:
- iD presets database (https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema) 
- iD presets icons (https://github.com/ideditor/temaki, https://github.com/mapbox/maki)
- Name Suggestion Index (https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index)
- NSI brand imagery (pulled from Facebook/Twitter/Wikipedia)
- StreetComplete quest filters (https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete)
- WebLate translations (https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/go-map/app)

### How to update external assets

Starting from the `src` directory:
- `(cd presets && ./update.sh)`				# fetches latest presets.json, etc. files and NSI
- `(cd presets && ./getBrandIcons.py)`		# downloads images from various websites and converts them to png as necessary
- `(cd presets && ./uploadBrandIcons.sh)`	# uploads imagery to gomaposm.com where they can be downloaded on demand at runtime (password required)
- `(cd POI-Icons && ./update.sh)`			# fetches maki/temaki icons 
- `(cd xliff && ./update.sh)`					# downloads latest translations from weblate (password required). This step is very noisy and produces many pages of warnings that can be ignored.

## Continuous integration

### Prerequisite

- Make sure you have _fastlane_ installed. (From a terminal, change to the `src/iOS` directory and run `bundle install`.)
- Since _fastlane_ stores your provisioning profiles and certificates in a Git repository (`MATCH_REPO`), you need to create a new, empty repository if you haven't already. The profiles and certificates are protected by a password (`MATCH_PASSWORD`).
- When creating the Beta locally, _fastlane_ will make sure that your certificates and provisioning profiles are up-to-date.

### How to release a Beta locally

You'll need to obtain the values for the following parameter:

- `MATCH_REPO`: The URL to the Git repository that contains the provisioning profiles/certificates
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`: The password for encrypting/decrypting the provisioning profiles/certificates
- `FASTLANE_TEAM_ID`: The ID of the developer team at developer.apple.com
- `FASTLANE_USER`: The email address that is used to sign in to App Store Connect
- `FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID`: The ID of the team at appstoreconnect.apple.com

In order to release a new Beta to the TestFlight testers, run

    % MATCH_REPO=<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL> \
      MATCH_PASSWORD=<MATCH_PASSWORD> \
      FASTLANE_TEAM_ID=<APPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM_ID> \
      FASTLANE_USER=<APP_STORE_CONNECT_EMAIL> \
      FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID=<APP_STORE_CONNECT_TEAM_ID> \
      bundle exec fastlane beta

## Formatting

In order to have a consistent code style, please make sure to install
[SwiftFormat][6] and run it on a regular basis. Consider setting up a `pre-commit`
Git hook, as described [here][7].

## Presets and translation

Go Map!! is using iD presets, so you can improve translations [by improving translations of iD presets](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema).
